- **Interactive Map & List Views** – Discover nearby events and groups  
- **Community Requests** – Users can submit requests for assistance  
- **Organization Needs** – Organizations can list specific items or volunteer needs    

## Technologies Used  
- **Android Studio** – Java & XML for frontend development  
- **Firebase Firestore** – Real-time database for users, events, and organizations  
- **Google Maps API** – Interactive map integration for location-based discovery  
- **Google Cloud Console** – API management and deployment  

## Future Enhancements
